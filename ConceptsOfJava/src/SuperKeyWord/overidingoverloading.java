	 * Method Overloading : Writing same methd with diffrent parametrs
	 * Method Overriding: Writing same method in different class
	 * Overloading happens at compile-time while Overriding happens at runtime: 
	 * Static methods can be overloaded which means a class can
	 * have more than one static method of same name. Static methods cannot be
	 * overridden, even if you declare a same static method in child class it has
	 * nothing to do with the same method of parent class. 
	 * The most basic difference is that overloading is being done in the same class while for overriding base
	 * and child classes are required. 
	 * 
	 * Static binding is
	 * being used for overloaded methods and 
	 * dynamic binding is being used for
	 * overridden/overriding methods. 
	 * 
	 * Performance: Overloading gives better performance compared to overriding. 
	 * The reason is that the binding of overridden methods is being done at runtime. 
	 * 
	 * private and final methods can be overloaded but they cannot be overridden. 
	 * 
	 * It means a class can have more than one private/final methods of same name 
	 *
	 * but a child class cannot override the private/final methods of their base class.
