	/*
	 * Both abstract class and interface are used for abstraction.
	 * 
	 * Interface:Interface can have only abstract methods. and implementation is done in 
	 * other class using implements key word
	 * Abstract: Abstract class can have abstract and non-abstract methods. and abtract methods are implemnted in 
	 * another class using extends key word
	 * 
	 * Abstraction: Hiding the internal implementation of the feature and only
	 * showing the functionality to the users. i.e. what it works (showing), how it
	 * works (hiding). 
	 * 
	 * Abstract class vs Interface 
	 * 
	 * 1. Type of methods: Interface can have only abstract methods. 
	 *     Abstract class can have abstract and non-abstract methods.
	 *     From Java 8, it can have default and static methods also.
	 * 
	 *  2. Final Variables: Variables declared in a Java interface are by default final. An abstract
	 * class may contain non-final variables. 
	 * 
	 * 3. Type of variables: Abstract class can have final, non-final, static and non-static variables. Interface has
	 * only static and final variables. 
	 * 
	 * 5. Inheritance vs Abstraction: A Java interface can be implemented using keyword “implements” and abstract class
	 * can be extended using keyword “extends”. 
	 * 
	 * 6. Multiple implementation: An interface can extend another Java interface only, an abstract class can
	 * extend another Java class and implement multiple Java interfaces. 
	 * 
	 * 7. Accessibility of Data Members: Members of a Java interface are public by
	 * default. A Java abstract class can have class members like private,
	 * protected, etc.
